  üîç Query 1: Get User's Channels

  SELECT
      c.id, c.project_id, c.name, c.created_at,
      p.name as project_name
  FROM chat_channels c
  JOIN channel_members cm ON c.id = cm.channel_id
  LEFT JOIN projects p ON c.project_id = p.id
  WHERE cm.user_id = $1
  ORDER BY c.created_at DESC

  ---
  üìñ Step-by-Step Explanation:

  Scenario: Nikhil logs in. Show him ALL channels he has access to.

  Tables involved:
  - chat_channels (c) - The channels
  - channel_members (cm) - Who's in which channel
  - projects (p) - Project details

  ---
  üéØ Breaking It Down:

  Line 1-2: SELECT what we want

  SELECT
      c.id, c.project_id, c.name, c.created_at,
      p.name as project_name

  What we're getting:
  - c.id ‚Üí Channel ID (e.g., 5)
  - c.project_id ‚Üí Which project? (e.g., 10)
  - c.name ‚Üí Channel name (e.g., "Website Redesign Chat")
  - c.created_at ‚Üí When was it created?
  - p.name as project_name ‚Üí Actual project name (e.g., "Website Redesign")

  ---
  Line 3: FROM chat_channels c

  FROM chat_channels c

  Start from: The chat_channels table (we call it c for short)

  Example data in chat_channels:
  | id  | project_id | name                  | created_by |
  |-----|------------|-----------------------|------------|
  | 1   | 5          | Website Redesign Chat | 1          |
  | 2   | 8          | Mobile App Chat       | 2          |
  | 3   | 5          | E-commerce Chat       | 1          |

  ---
  Line 4: JOIN channel_members

  JOIN channel_members cm ON c.id = cm.channel_id

  Why JOIN? We need to know WHO is in each channel!

  Example data in channel_members:
  | id  | channel_id | user_id    |
  |-----|------------|------------|
  | 1   | 1          | 1 (Nikhil) |
  | 2   | 1          | 2 (Mridul) |
  | 3   | 2          | 2 (Mridul) |
  | 4   | 3          | 1 (Nikhil) |

  What JOIN does: Combine channels with their members

  Result after JOIN:
  | c.id | c.name                | cm.user_id |
  |------|-----------------------|------------|
  | 1    | Website Redesign Chat | 1 (Nikhil) |
  | 1    | Website Redesign Chat | 2 (Mridul) |
  | 2    | Mobile App Chat       | 2 (Mridul) |
  | 3    | E-commerce Chat       | 1 (Nikhil) |

  ---
  Line 5: LEFT JOIN projects

  LEFT JOIN projects p ON c.project_id = p.id

  Why LEFT JOIN? Get project name for display!

  LEFT JOIN vs JOIN:
  - JOIN = Only rows that match in BOTH tables
  - LEFT JOIN = All rows from left table, even if no match in right table

  Why LEFT? Some channels might not have a project (direct messages have project_id = NULL)

  Example projects:
  | id  | name             | user_id |
  |-----|------------------|---------|
  | 5   | Website Redesign | 1       |
  | 8   | Mobile App       | 2       |

  After LEFT JOIN:
  | c.id | c.name                | p.name (project_name) |
  |------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
  | 1    | Website Redesign Chat | Website Redesign      |
  | 2    | Mobile App Chat       | Mobile App            |
  | 3    | Direct Message        | NULL (no project)     |

  ---
  Line 6: WHERE filter

  WHERE cm.user_id = $1

  Filter: Only channels where Nikhil (user_id = 1) is a member!

  If Nikhil's user_id = 1:
  - ‚úÖ Channel 1 (Nikhil is member)
  - ‚ùå Channel 2 (Nikhil is NOT member)
  - ‚úÖ Channel 3 (Nikhil is member)

  Result: Only channels 1 and 3

  ---
  Line 7: ORDER BY

  ORDER BY c.created_at DESC

  Sort: Newest channels first (DESC = descending)

  ---
  üéØ Final Result for Nikhil:

  | id  | project_id | name                  | project_name     |
  |-----|------------|-----------------------|------------------|
  | 3   | 5          | E-commerce Chat       | E-commerce       |
  | 1   | 5          | Website Redesign Chat | Website Redesign |

  This is what appears in Nikhil's sidebar! üì±

  üîç Query 2: Get Channel with Messages

  -- First check membership
  SELECT * FROM channel_members
  WHERE channel_id = $1 AND user_id = $2

  -- Then get messages
  SELECT
      m.*,
      u.name as sender_name
  FROM messages m
  JOIN users u ON m.user_id = u.id
  WHERE m.channel_id = $1
  ORDER BY m.created_at DESC
  LIMIT 50

  ---
  üìñ Part A: Check Membership (Security!)

  SELECT * FROM channel_members
  WHERE channel_id = $1 AND user_id = $2

  Why? Before showing messages, verify user has access!

  Example:
  - Nikhil tries to open channel 5
  - $1 = 5 (channel_id)
  - $2 = 1 (Nikhil's user_id)

  Query checks: Is Nikhil a member of channel 5?

  If NO rows returned: Nikhil is NOT a member ‚Üí Return 403 Forbidden ‚ùå
  If row returned: Nikhil IS a member ‚Üí Show messages ‚úÖ

  ---
  üìñ Part B: Get Messages

  SELECT
      m.*,
      u.name as sender_name
  FROM messages m
  JOIN users u ON m.user_id = u.id
  WHERE m.channel_id = $1
  ORDER BY m.created_at DESC
  LIMIT 50

  Step-by-step:

  Line 1-2: SELECT

  SELECT
      m.*,
      u.name as sender_name

  Get: - m.* ‚Üí All message data (id, content, created_at, etc.)
 
  - u.name as sender_name ‚Üí Who sent it? (e.g., "Nikhil")

  ---
  Line 3: FROM messages m

  Start from: messages table

  Example messages:
  | id  | channel_id | user_id | content             | created_at |
  |-----|------------|---------|---------------------|------------|
  | 1   | 5          | 1       | "Hello!"            | 10:00      |
  | 2   | 5          | 2       | "Hi there!"         | 10:01      |
  | 3   | 7          | 1       | "Different channel" | 10:02      |

  ---
  Line 4: JOIN users

  JOIN users u ON m.user_id = u.id

  Why? Messages only have user_id (number). We need the person's NAME!

  Example users:
  | id  | name   |
  |-----|--------|
  | 1   | Nikhil |
  | 2   | Mridul |

  After JOIN:
  | m.id | m.content   | m.user_id | u.name |
  |------|-------------|-----------|--------|
  | 1    | "Hello!"    | 1         | Nikhil |
  | 2    | "Hi there!" | 2         | Mridul |

  ---
  Line 5: WHERE filter

  WHERE m.channel_id = $1

  Filter: Only messages from THIS channel (channel 5)

  Result:
  - ‚úÖ Message 1 (channel 5)
  - ‚úÖ Message 2 (channel 5)
  - ‚ùå Message 3 (channel 7, different channel)

  ---
  Line 6-7: ORDER and LIMIT

  ORDER BY m.created_at DESC
  LIMIT 50

  ORDER BY DESC: Newest messages first
  LIMIT 50: Only last 50 messages (pagination)

  Final Result:
  | id  | content     | sender_name | created_at |
  |-----|-------------|-------------|------------|
  | 2   | "Hi there!" | Mridul      | 10:01      |
  | 1   | "Hello!"    | Nikhil      | 10:00      |

  üîç Query 3: Create Channel

  -- Insert channel
  INSERT INTO chat_channels (project_id, channel_type, name, created_by)
  VALUES ($1, 'project', $2, $3)
  RETURNING *

  -- Add member
  INSERT INTO channel_members (channel_id, user_id)
  VALUES ($1, $2)

  ---
  üìñ Part A: Insert Channel

  INSERT INTO chat_channels (project_id, channel_type, name, created_by)
  VALUES ($1, 'project', $2, $3)
  RETURNING *

  Example values:
  - $1 = 5 (project_id = 5)
  - $2 = 'Website Redesign Chat' (name)
  - $3 = 1 (created_by = Nikhil's user_id)

  What happens:
  INSERT INTO chat_channels (project_id, channel_type, name, created_by)
  VALUES (5, 'project', 'Website Redesign Chat', 1)
  RETURNING *

  *RETURNING : Return the newly created row!

  Result:
  {
    "id": 10,
    "project_id": 5,
    "channel_type": "project",
    "name": "Website Redesign Chat",
    "created_by": 1,
    "created_at": "2025-10-13 15:30:00"
  }

  Now we have channel ID = 10!

  ---
  üìñ Part B: Add Member

  INSERT INTO channel_members (channel_id, user_id)
  VALUES ($1, $2)

  Example:
  - $1 = 10 (the channel we just created)
  - $2 = 1 (Nikhil's user_id)

  What happens:
  INSERT INTO channel_members (channel_id, user_id)
  VALUES (10, 1)

  Result: Nikhil is now a member of channel 10!

  If project has a client (user_id = 2):
  INSERT INTO channel_members (channel_id, user_id)
  VALUES (10, 2)

  Now both Nikhil AND Mridul are members!

  ---
  üéØ Complete Flow Example:

  Scenario: Nikhil creates a project "Website Redesign" and assigns client Mridul

  Step 1: Create channel
  INSERT INTO chat_channels (project_id, name, created_by)
  VALUES (5, 'Website Redesign Chat', 1)
  RETURNING *
  -- Returns: channel id = 10

  Step 2: Add Nikhil as member
  INSERT INTO channel_members (channel_id, user_id)
  VALUES (10, 1)

  Step 3: Add Mridul as member
  INSERT INTO channel_members (channel_id, user_id)
  VALUES (10, 2)

  Result:
  - ‚úÖ Channel created
  - ‚úÖ Nikhil can access it
  - ‚úÖ Mridul can access it
  - ‚úÖ They can chat in real-time!

  ‚úÖ Do You Understand Now?

  Test yourself:

  1. Why JOIN channel_members? ‚Üí To know who's in each channel
  2. Why LEFT JOIN projects? ‚Üí Some channels might not have projects (direct messages)
  3. Why check membership first? ‚Üí Security! Don't show messages to non-members
  4. What does RETURNING * do? ‚Üí Returns the newly created row with its ID
  5. Why LIMIT 50? ‚Üí Don't load all messages at once (performance)
