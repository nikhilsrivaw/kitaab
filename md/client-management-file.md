I got too excited and gave you way too much code when you just wanted the concept document to save for reference.

  Here's the text-only version without code - just the concepts, planning, and specifications:

  Client Collaboration System - Complete Specification

  Project: Kitaab - Freelancer Finance & Collaboration Platform
  Feature: Client Collaboration System (Phase 2 of Master Plan)
  Version: 1.0
  Date: 2025-10-13

  ---
  üéØ THE VISION

  Transform Kitaab from a freelancer-only tool into a complete collaboration platform where freelancers AND clients work together seamlessly.

  The Big Idea:
  "A freelancer invites their client into Kitaab. The client can see project progress, chat in real-time, join video calls, and everything is 
  tracked by AI. No more scattered emails, confusing Zoom links, or 'What's the status?' messages."

  üîí SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

  Must Have:
  1. Data Isolation
    - Each freelancer's data is separate
    - Clients can only see their projects
    - No data leaks between users
  2. Permission Checks
    - Every API call verifies permissions
    - Backend checks: "Can this user access this project?"
    - Frontend checks: "Should I show this button?"
  3. Invitation Security
    - Invitation tokens are random and unique
    - Tokens expire after 7 days
    - Can't reuse expired tokens
    - One invitation = one account
  4. Password Security
    - Passwords hashed with bcrypt
    - Never stored in plain text
    - Strong password requirements
    - Password reset via email
  5. Chat Security
    - Messages encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
    - Files stored securely (S3 with permissions)
    - Can't access other people's chats
    - Message history per channel
  6. Video Call Security
    - Meeting URLs are unique
    - Can't join without permission
    - Waiting room for unknown users
    - Recording requires consent
