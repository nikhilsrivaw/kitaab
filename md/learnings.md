Your Real Use Case

  You're a developer who:
  - Takes on client projects (tasks with #client tag)
  - Spends money upfront (API costs, hosting, tools)
  - Gets paid later when project completes
  - Wants to track: Did this project make me money overall?

  This is a real problem! And a great project to build.

  The Concept (In Simple Terms)

  Think of it like this:

  PROJECT: "Build AI Chatbot for Client"
  ├─ Tasks:
  │  ├─ Set up API (#client #urgent)
  │  ├─ Design UI (#client)
  │  └─ Deploy (#client)
  │
  └─ Finances:
     ├─ EXPENSES:
     │  ├─ OpenAI API credits: -$50
     │  └─ Hosting: -$20
     │
     └─ INCOME:
        └─ Client payment: +$500

  PROFIT = $500 - $70 = $430 ✓

  So each PROJECT has:
  - Multiple tasks (tagged)
  - Associated expenses (your costs)
  - Associated income (client payments)
  - NET RESULT: Did you make money?

  Now Let's Define The MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

  Here's what I think you need FIRST (the simplest version):

  MUST HAVE (Build This First):

  1. Projects
  - Create a project (name, description)
  - View list of projects

  2. Tasks
  - Create tasks inside a project
  - Add tags (#client, #urgent, #personal, #learning)
  - Mark complete/incomplete
  - View tasks by project

  3. Finances
  - Add expense to a project (amount, category, date, note)
  - Add income to a project (amount, source, date)
  - Simple form entry (receipts come later!)

  4. Dashboard
  - See all projects
  - For each project: Total expenses, total income, profit/loss
  - Weekly summary (this week's spending)

  LATER (Version 2):

  - Receipt uploads
  - Charts/graphs
  - Time tracking per task
  - Recurring expenses
  - Export reports

  DREAM (Version 3):

  - AI analysis
  - Predictions
  - Client invoicing

  Does This Match Your Vision?

  Before we go further:

  1. Is this the right direction? (freelancer project profit tracker)
  2. Is the MVP list good? (or did I miss something critical?)
  3. Ready to move to the next phase? (technical planning - choosing tech stack)
